# machostname

## Set hostname based on MAC address

### Why?

I needed some mechanism to automatically set hostname of my Fujitsu Futro S900 cluster booted from single PXE root hosted over NFS in read-only. Also I'm learning Go. Code itself is in single function, as it has to do one job, and do it well.

### How?
```
make
make install
systemctl enable machostname
```

### Example systemctl log
```
root@eric:~# systemctl status machostname
